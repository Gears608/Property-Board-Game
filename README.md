<h1>About</h1>
This project is a simple digital version of Monopoly created as part of a group project. Used Plastic SCM for version control.
<h1>Motivation</h1>
The purpose of this project was to experience and learn methods of working as a group to complete a project.
<h1>Method</h1>
For working as a group in this project we used the Agile methodology of development. At the start we created a project timeline with tasks sorted 
with their importance and duration. We had weekly meetings to discuss progress and whether a task would be completed on time, early or late and changed the plan based on this.
